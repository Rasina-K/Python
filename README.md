Welcome to my Python Projects Repository! Within this repository, you'll find a compilation of my data science projects, serving as a showcase of my proficiency and expertise in the field. Each project uniquely illustrates various facets of data analysis, machine learning, and visualizatio






# 1 Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection 
Credit card fraud is a challenging problem that involves the unauthorized use of someone's credit or debit card information to make purchases or withdraw funds from their account.
Fraud detection is a proactive measure undertaken to identify and prevent these types of activities and control financial loss.
